# Project Summary

After following the Unity VR Beginner: The Escape Room tutorial for a loose introduction to the Unity XR interaction toolkit. I found a tutorial by YouTube channel Zigurous on [how to make a Fruit Ninja clone](https://youtu.be/xTT1Ae_ifhM) in Unity. I loosely followed this tutorial and adapted the cutting mechanism into VR to cut an orb in half with a sword. This was mainly a small project to mess around and get a feel for the Unity XR systems.
